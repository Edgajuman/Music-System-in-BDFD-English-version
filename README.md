## Additions in the previous version
- Improved the premium system to offer more advantages to PREMIUM bots
- NOW YOUR BOT CAN PLAY MUSIC FROM YOUTUBE BY NAME OR URL
- Pause and Resume functionality
- Skip functionality
- Action buttons
- Playlist
- Action loading improved; responses are now faster (except !play, which requires music search)
- Added user voice channel presence checks
- Now shows the names of the currently playing songs
- Volume control system added
- Rewind system added
- Fixed a bug that caused the entire playlist to repeat when loading new music
- Added a Music Card for a visually appealing view during !play
- Implemented additional necessary checks (thanks to this, the "play" variable is no longer required)
- Now when your bot is disconnected from the voice channel without using !stop, the playlist will be automatically deleted (to avoid glitched playback and improve the experience)

## Additions in the new version v5.0
- Buttons will now always appear on the most recently added song
- Greatly reduced the errors that prevented songs from being added
- Fixed issues for NON-PREMIUM bots
- Added AI system (This system will give song recommendations and add them to the playlist automatically)
- Changed search library for better readability and to avoid most common errors
- Added color to buttons and action names
- Added a download system to download the currently playing song (Only for 1 minute, after that it wonâ€™t be downloadable)

## Possible Bugs
The system is fully functional, although there are a few bugs that will be fixed over time.
Some known issues:
- Songs not being added to the playlist (rarely happens, mostly depends on YouTube's API and video permissions)

# Music System in BDFD v4.1 (PATCH)

An advanced system for playing music with your Discord bot in Bot Designer For Discord.

## Configuration

#### You only need to create 1 variable

| name | value |
| :-------- | :------- |
| `TOKEN` | `Your Discord bot token` |

## Commands
- !play
- !stop
- !vol
- $onInteraction (2)

## New Stuff and Updates
- Improved the premium system to give more advantages to PREMIUM bots
- NOW YOUR BOT CAN PLAY YOUTUBE MUSIC BY NAME OR URL
- Pause and Resume Function
- Skip Function
- Action Buttons
- Playlist
- Fixed loading actions, now they respond faster, except for !play, since it searches for music
- Added checks to see if the user is in a channel or not
- Added names of currently playing music
- Added a volume system
- Added a Backspace
- Fixed the bug that caused the entire playlist to repeat when loading new music
- Added a Music Card for an attractive music view in !play
- Implemented more necessary checks (thanks to this, the "play" variable will no longer be needed)
- Now, when your bot is disconnected from the voice channel without the !stop, the playlist will be automatically deleted (this improves the experience and prevents bugged playback)

## Possible Bugs
The system is fully functional, although it has some bugs that will be fixed later.
Some bugs may include:
- Not adding music to the playlist (rarely, this depends more on the YouTube API and video permissions)

## BotPanel
> A panel has been developed for your bot that uses this music system.
